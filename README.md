# Staxx

## Overview

* Staxx is a web application that allows its users to categorically track their expenses over a chosen peroid of time.

* After the user has created an account they are then presented with a pop-up modal that allows them to select the chosen time period of either a week or a month and enter the amount of money they would like to allot for that chosen time period.

* Through the dashboard interface the user can then easily enter their transactions as they go, view all their transactions, and view a summary of their transactions as a graph.
